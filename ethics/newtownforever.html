        Through the lens of foundational ethics, equal access and opportunity for the wider public is of chief concern when attempting to make a design accessible. Transportation methods in a highly public forum such as Newtown must cater to the community through providing a myriad of modes of transportation to be used easily and safely for participants of a broad spectrum of abilities. <br>
        <br>
        First-hand observational behavioural analysis of the site informed the decision to focus on pedestrian and cycle networks within the area, identifying the sizable amount of traffic currently occupying the footpaths and car lanes along Newtown&rsquo;s main road. The busy (and at times chaotic roads) within the suburb appear dangerous for cyclists who are forced to cycle among the cars on the roads, especially for less skilled riders. Observation of the area during peak-traffic times on both weekdays and weekends lead to the identification of strategies that would improve the lives and the general safety of occupants within Newtown. Ethically, the observation of the needs of the public in an indiscriminatory manner was an ethical consideration implemented by designers. The decision to create a shared motor-lane directly stems from this first-hand observational analysis of the traffic conditions, where the direction of heavy traffic was noted at different times of the day. <br>        
    </p>
    <p id="text2" class="paragraph" onclick="hideText(this.id)">
        Ethically, in accepting a project such as this urban renewal, the architects essentially absorb the responsibility of meeting the needs of the public with no differential consideration or treatment. This means adequate room for motor vehicles, motor bicycles, public buses, bicycles, scooters, and pedestrians of differing ability levels should be considered thoroughly and in collaboration with one another. Whether it be due to financial, mental health or physical ability reasons, some individuals are not able to drive any form of motor vehicles; the inclusion of widened footpaths and clear, wide bicycle lanes is a relatively easy and low cost means of designing for the community and making Newtown a safe and welcoming suburb. Alternatively, for the same list of reasons, some people are only able to travel privately or publicly with motor vehicles. The project design remains feasible as it does not impede on anyone&rsquo;s ability to travel using their preferred method. The addition of a shared motor lane could compensate for the increased traffic levels that may result from these changes, however. As someone with a number of disabled family members, I have witnessed first-hand how difficult and demoralising daily tasks can be for the disabled community when their needs are not accounted for in terms of transportation; and thus I feel strongly about an architect/urban designer&rsquo;s ethical responsibility to cater for all ability levels.
    </p>
    <p id="text3" class="paragraph" onclick="hideText(this.id)">
        An issue that hinders much of the potential for accessible design is the associated cost of designing universally. In a completely ethical world, this would be seen as a priority and thus warrant the expenditure no matter the cost. Unfortunately, this is not the case with majority of designs. When considering why this might not be so, debate has risen around whether those in positions of power in the design process value accessible design over cost efficiency. The contemporary capitalist agenda that drives most development regrettably does not place importance on inclusivity over profit. <br>
        <br>
        In terms of striving for a resolution (or at least an improvement) in this area, perhaps we need to reconsider the traditional professional hierarchies that inform designs such as this one. How many (if any) of the voices that drive change part of the disabled community? Aiming to create the most diverse design team possible in all levels of such a hierarchy would greatly benefit many areas of design, both in ethical and functional terms. As discussed in class, diversity often breeds a broader scope of who the design can benefit in many areas, not only with accessibility standards in mind.<br>
        <br>
        Another positive way forward could be the potential for the government subsidising of accessible and universal design. If the Australian government would afford more of a budget to organisations that strive towards inclusivity in design, perhaps the built environment could evolve to be a more accommodating space for all. This subsidy could come in the form of philanthropic donations, grants towards retrofitting existing and future buildings with accessible design and a multitude of other streams of change. <br>
        <br>
        In summary, an array of foundational ethics questions and concerns are raised when considering accessible design within architecture as a profession. The deliberate and constant consideration of this is necessary to ensure contemporary designs cater for the wider community of all abilities. Doing so affords individuals their independence and dignity in navigating the built environment. <br>

        One of the main topics discussed in Retcon 1 was the lack representation and consideration of<br>
        Indigenous culture in the project. From start to end, indigenous history was not taken into consideration,<br>
        the people where not represented, and in the solutions, we as designers did not create<br>
        spaces for these communities to thrive. In Australia, the laws and regulations towards the indigenous<br>
        communities is still under development and needs a lot of work. This is why most architect<br>
        don&rsquo;t have any guidelines to follow when working on a project, ending up neglecting the indigenous<br>
        culture and unfortunately sometimes stepping on it while harming communities.<br>
        In terms of foundational ethics, ego and power play a big role in the lack of indigenous culture.<br>
        Since the first western settlement in Australia, mainly white people in power killed, raped, and<br>
        imprisoned aboriginal communities. They wanted to erase these communities or at least &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo;<br>
        them, in order to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into their societies. In order to do that, they removed children from<br>
        their original families and put them in white families, changed their names, taught them the &ldquo;western&rdquo;<br>
        way of doing things, etc. These atrocities were committed without being well written and<br>
        escribed in history books, a lot of crimes were hidden or lied about facts and numbers. The government<br>
        didn&rsquo;t write most of the indigenous deaths, and until recently, aboriginal history was not<br>
        taught in schools or spoken about on national platforms. This made it hard to find any relevant<br>
        papers and books about the history of any site chosen and most of the articles found would be<br>
        related to after western settlements, ignoring the past owners of the land. Ego and power play a<br>
        big role in the system and hierarchy, these two are related since the whole system in Australia is<br>
        based on western settlements and was built on aboriginal land and abused their communities in<br>
        order to create a hierarchy where only white people can be in power. This limits minorities to speak<br>
        up and express their concerns, since aboriginal communities are a minority in Australia it took a long<br>
        time to achieve the most basic of human rights and still needs a lot of work to reach full equality.

        <p>
            The representatives in the system are elected based on votes, and since the majority is<br>
            white and other minorities are not well represented in schools and the system, most of<br>
            the representatives will be white and working towards keeping these minorities in the<br>
            shade to keep their power. This also relates to the worldwide capitalism system, where<br>
            the rich will become richer and feed off the poor, it&rsquo;s a system that &ldquo;modernises&rdquo; slavery<br>
            and makes the rich look as &ldquo;good people&rdquo;. The big capitalist countries just moved &ldquo;slavery&rdquo;<br>
            out of the communities to third world countries, where they benefit from very<br>
            cheap taxes, rent, and workers, then proceed to sell it in their markets for way more,<br>
            making big profits while these third world countries are taken advantage living under<br>
            the minimum wage. When looking at it from a bird&rsquo;s eye perspective, the world didn&rsquo;t<br>
            really change it just shifted its atrocities to other areas where media can&rsquo;t reach. This<br>
            way local communities will be happy and satisfied living a comfortable life, without worrying<br>
            about these issues since it&rsquo;s far far away from them. Even with that being said,<br>
            other minorities are achieving minimal wins in our communities, but still lack representation<br>
            nationally.<br>
            For the methodology, I believe we should focus on the bigger picture rather than focusing<br>
            just on our industry. If the whole system doesn&rsquo;t start to apply general rules and regulations<br>
            to protect indigenous communities, the smaller sectors will definitely not work<br>
            towards improving their own way of working with these minorities. More representation<br>
            on a national scale, will definitely impact communities and showcase the struggle of<br>
            minorities. Educating people in schools about these topics is a must for change because<br>
            it&rsquo;s. more than just a system, it&rsquo;s a mentality and a way of living. These changes will<br>
            impact the system, and hopefully make change on the long run. Human rights must be<br>
            part of every political party, it shouldn&rsquo;t be on someone&rsquo;s agenda to fight for these<br>
            things. Lastly, funding is major part to achieve recognition. Indigenous history and<br>
            culture should be funded by the government in order to work on their own communities<br>
            and integrate their values into the system. Aboriginal historians should be more funded<br>
            to write about the land and their communities, helping people get more educated on<br>
            these foundational topics.

            A good example would be the M&#257;ori community in New Zealand, even though the example is not<br>
            perfect, it&rsquo;s definitely more advanced and a step further than the current state of the Aboriginal<br>
            communities in Australia. The New Zealand Government have reserved seats for the M&#257;ori in the<br>
            parliament, and always speak about their issues in the chamber, this allows constant representation<br>
            in the system. Another important fact is representation on national TV, the Haka is performed<br>
            before every rugby game, which one of the most famous sport in New Zealand, this adds to indigenous<br>
            representation and respect their traditions and culture. M&#257;ori language is included within the<br>
            government, English and M&#257;ori are used for signs, buildings, texts, on national TV, etc&#8230; Recently,<br>
            they even wanted to change the name of New Zealand to its original M&#257;ori name, the petition was<br>
            signed by many locals, and it was passed to the government where it was denied, but at least it was<br>
            a step further to achieve equality and bring back indigenous culture to the land and pay respect.<br>
            In conclusion, The Newtown project could have been more inclusive and considering about Indigenous<br>
            culture. As part of the team, we should&rsquo;ve dig deeper into these matters and give it more time<br>
            to understand the original owners of the land, in order to design a better solution. Looking back at<br>
            the way work was divided and the hierarchy of the team, only one of us was assigned to look into<br>
            the aboriginal history of the land, the person chosen was a foreigner and had limited knowledge on<br>
            the topic, which led us to ignore it. This should&rsquo;ve been done by the team as whole and gather as<br>
            much information on it in order to work for a better indigenous representation. Ego might&rsquo;ve been<br>
            another issue since none of us identified as aboriginal, we might&rsquo;ve felt like it&rsquo;s not our case to<br>
            carry, but we could&rsquo;ve asked and involved some indigenous people in our research and asked them<br>
            what they would want to improve in the suburb. As mentioned in the methods section, education<br>
            should incorporate indigenous culture, and tutors should help us be aware of the situation and lead<br>
            us towards it, in our case our tutor didn&rsquo;t mention any indigenous related topics in our research and<br>
            study, and we thought we were on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; track. Looking on the solutions, there&rsquo;s a lot of minimal<br>
            things we could&rsquo;ve done to help community and make it easier for them to thrive.
