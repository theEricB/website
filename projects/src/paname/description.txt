For the redesign of the main stage on ground level of a stand-up comedy club in Paris, we designed a “3D” wall to be the background of the comedian while on stage as well as an identifying factor for the bar itself.
The algorithm behind it was quite simple, but I got the chance to not only design the system, but also to make sure that the thing actually gets built. Therefore the plan for construction was drawn in Grasshopper with laying out precise measurements between the bricks and towards a single axis, which was then displayed by a calibrated laser on site, to assist the construction worker.
