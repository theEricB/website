<p>Hi F&eacute;licie,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I feel like shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But first, your handwriting is terrible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have been gone for 4 hours, and I just read through the last page of my sketchbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It made me cry for half an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I did underestimate the impact you have on my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I miss you.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Then I thought I am good again and searched for distraction on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, great try. First thing I see is your story, and here we go again^^.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So I went running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dropped my Airpod, found it back half an hour later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now I feel better.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know it is not going to be easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you know what, I really like you, and we gonna get through it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is gonna be facetime calls where we will be bored, unmotivated or sth else, but it doesn&apos;t matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we see each other again 4real, we both know we gonna be happy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Till then, let&apos;s still enjoy live, you with the naked old guys and I my with the alternative young guy and cats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And btw I am certain you gonna find an awesome flat in Paris, which you will decorate really cool, with a lot of lights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&apos;t forget to send some pics when you bake your first bread there:)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I know it is not the best prose ever, but it tooked me your whole flight time to finish it, so please appreciate it;)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ich liebe Dich!</p>
<p>Eric</p>
